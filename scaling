We have used ethereum blockchain. User can perform average 15 transactions per second. If we consider visa payment gateway, currently it is capable to process 45k transactions per second.
 Using ethereum, It is impossible to process more number of transactions as it uses proof work algorithm which involves huge computation which yeild into less number of transactions to process.
In order to improve the performance of the application:
1. Use POA(proof od authority algoritm instead of pow).
2. Ethereum latest realease come with PoS algorithm. Ethereumm with PoS is capable to perform 1000 transactions per second.
3.
